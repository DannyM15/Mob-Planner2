# Mob-Planner2

## Description

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

My motivation was to build an app that can help people be more organized with their daily tasks.  The challenges presented in this assignment were how to use Jquery in our Javascript.  Another challenge was to replace the class in the div based off the time given by dayjs.  Through my efforts I was able to learn more about dayjs and Jquuery for my future projects.  I had an issue where the classes were not updating however once I moved a line of code with a "this" inside the proper function the jquery was targetting the correct function.
